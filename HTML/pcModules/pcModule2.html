    <h1>Blink Buzz Vroom</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This module was all about getting our bearings with the Arduino. Like I said before, I have never worked 
        with electrical currents or physical computing so this was all new, and really interesting to me.

            <div><p>The first Arduino project we completed in class was using the ultrasonic sensor to detect objects. We wanted to make a the buzzer 
                go off when it detected an object in front of it.

            <div><p>The code was from Tinkercad, however setting up the new Arduino IDE was interesting. It's cool to see the 
                difference between other IDE's and how they compare against Processing and VSCode. In the code, we changed certain lines to 
                try to 'break' the code and better understand what each line did.

            <div><h3>The build</h3></div>
            <div><p>Physically building my first electrical circuit was really interesting. I found the pins a bit arduous sometimes and felt the wires got 
                pretty complex even with just a few of them. I didnt know how breadboards worked which as interesting, especailly about current automatically travelling vertical or horizontal
                depending on which section of the board you are in.

            <div><h3>The concept of Ground</h3></div>
            <div><p>The word ground kept being mentioned but I didn't know what that was reffering to. I did some independent research reading and watching videos
                to get my head around it. Essentially, Ground is the return path for electrical current because it is an electrical sink. The charge needs somewhere to go after completing its 
                circuit, which is why it goes to Ground. "True earth ground" refers to physically putting metal in the actual dirt or ground which is where the name comes from.

            <div><h3>Potentiometer</h3></div>
            <div><p>A potentiometer is a type of resistor with a control knob similar to a dial. The idea behind this is the adjust the current and be able to variably control
                electrical components. After our inital build we were getting annoyed with how loud the buzzer was, so we added the potentiometer to restrict its volume.
