    <h1>Research Journal Progress</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This module tracks the progress of making my Research Journal. The Research Journal is a collated PDF with 11 entries of interesting 
        interactive media case studies. Creating a PDF using media queries was not something I had done previously, so it was really interesting to learn how to work with Excel sheets, 
        CSVs and print Media Queries.

            <div><h3>Excel Spreadsheet</h3></div>
            <div><p>The first step to creating my research journal was collating the resources and case studies themselves. I tracked their details in an Excel spreadsheet. 
                I had collected some of these during class time from class discussions, some from my Hunt N Gather and others from specific research efforts. I tried to cover a spread of 
                topics, from data to VR to visual design.

            <div><h3>CSV</h3></div>
            <div><p>After completing the Excel spreadsheet, I had to export it as a CSV file. I had never made my own CSV file so it was interesting seeing 
                the conversion work. I imported this into VSCode to use on the HTML.
