    <h1>Research Journal Progress</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This module is focussed on responsive design and media queries. Though I missed this class due to a medical appointment, I have used this as an opportunity to 
        analyse the responsiveness of my website and plan the most ideal scenario for mobile screens. Below shows the sketches for a mobile device, as well as the various other sizes of layout that 
        my website should account for, on multiple different pages.

    <div class="moduleContainer left">
        <div><img src="../../ASSETS/2A-Module5_0283.jpg" alt="green square" class="moduleImage"></div>
        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Wide Screen</h3></div>
            <div><p>Ideally the wide screen layout would include a more spacious approach, where the full width of the 
                screen is taken advantage of. The module page can be very spacious which would work well with other visual
                assets, adn the site dev page can have a large grid able to view lots of content at once.
            </p></div>

    <div class="moduleContainer right ">
        <div><img src="../../ASSETS/2A-Module5_0284.jpg" alt="green square" class="moduleImage"></div>
        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Compressed or Narrower Laptop</h3></div>
            <div><p>When condensing the webpage it is important to me that the content slides over one another. For example, in the contents page I would like the words to condense at their 
                set height, eventually becoming a vertical list of roughly evenly spaced items.
            </p></div>

    <div class="moduleContainer left">
        <div><img src="../../ASSETS/2A-Module5_0285.jpg" alt="green square" class="moduleImage"></div>
        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Mobile Display</h3></div>
            <div><p>For a mobile layout I would like to be cautious about making the screen too crowded. This functionality may be a later priority, as I would like 
                to add decorations at some point. Until then, the ideal mobile layout would be card like behaviour with images and information stacked vertically.
