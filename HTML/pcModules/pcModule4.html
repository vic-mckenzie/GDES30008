    <h1>Sketching and storyboarding</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This module intended to collect our previous brainstorming into a more resolved wireframe. Though these are still hand sketches,
        they provide a more detailed view of what my website might looks like, after having settled on the 'sketchbook' theme. I chose this 
        theme because I felt it was the idea that felt the most natural to integrate progress photos and rough sketches, and had really good scalability to make a website
        visually appealing, and interactive. Despite this, I would love 
        the opportunity to create something else artistic using HTML, CSS and JS, that might fit better without the documentation requirement.

            <div><p>I would like this landing page to be really simple and clean, with an animation added, perhaps at a later stage. I would like this 
                to resemeble the sleek black outside of most sketch books, that are very simplistic, hiding the artistic chaos within. Simple instructions 
                will work best here.

                I would like this page to be quite chaotic and visually stimulating, feeling abundant and expressive. At later stages I may 
                add animations or hover effects over the sketches too. The key goal of this page is to link to the 3 main subsections of the book, corresponding to projects 2A, B and C.

            <div><p>The layout for the module page I would like to be more structured. Here, my focus is communicating messages and showcasing progress photos,
                so artistic distractions, whilst still interesting, should be more restricted. A structured photo and text combination will make my reflections for each activity clear.

            <div><h3>Site Progress Page</h3></div>
            <div><p>One of my other goals for this first project, 2A, was to create an entirely seperate Site Progress page to document my brainstorming, and 
                website design. I chose this because I think seperating the in class activities from website development is more clear, and this also has the opporutnity for a layout 
                that can show more photos at once, rather than focussing on a more artistic style like the module pages.
