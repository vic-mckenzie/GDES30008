    <h1>What's in the box?</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">The start of 2C and our physical computing classes was about establishing a baseline for what physical computing is, and the components
        used to create physical computing projects. I had never done physical computing, physics or anything with electricity before so this was all brand new to me.<h2>

            <div><h3>Arduino Box contents overview</h3></div>
            <div><p>When unpacking the box I realised just how many different moving parts there are to physical computing. Even simple movement
                seems like it would require alot of different pieces. We guessed at some, and then labelled all the items with their correct names. It makes me 
                appreciate how much technology is in the things we use regularly like phones or speakers.

            <div><h3>Ultrasonic Sensor</h3></div>
            <div><p>The ultrasonic sensor is one of the first components we worked with. I initally thought they were speakers,
                but it actually uses SONAR waves to sense the distance of objects around it. It reminds me of echolocation like used by 
                bats.

            <div><p>Capacitors sounded very complex and only reminded me of the 'flux capacitor' in Back to the Future. Capacitors
                are used to process and store the energy from a power supply. They are important to keep energy levels stable. There are different types of 
                capacitors that can be used for different things. They also have different length legs.

            <div><h3>Resistors</h3></div>
            <div><p>The first thing I noticed about resistors is the fact they can come in a variety of types, with different coloured
                patterns on them. I learnt from extra research that these colours actually have meanings and correspond to mathmatical formulas to
                determine its type. Resistors are used to create electrical resistance and reduce the flow of electricity, as well as other things.

                by far one of the most used sensors in the original box. Many weather projects and plant based moisture projects are common for beginner Ardunio projects.

            <div><p>As I wasn't super comfortable with the idea of the Arduino yet, I decided to order my own arduino kit. Though I'm not sure 
                how much I'll use it in the future it was definitely interesting and made me feel more comfortable when learning about it in class. I also watched
                alot of Youtube videos to learn more about projects. Also, my sister's partner turns out to be really into this physical computing and told 
                me about a functional 3D printer he made with an Ardunio!
