    <h1>Ideation, Sketches and Storyboarding</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">In physical computing, we were really encouraged to think big. I completed multiple
        brainstorming sessions outside of class time, by myself, with my partner, roommates and family to see what we could come up with usingthe capabilities of 
        physical computing. Below is a random sampling of some of my favourites.

            <div><h3>Dance Mate</h3></div>
            <div><p>Dance Mate was based on one of my friends problems about her dancing. She said its really hard to teach a class because you have to keep going to the front of the room and changing the 
                music back to the start of the section you are working on. Voice assistants also dont work because of the loud atmosphere. To fix this, I storyboarded an idea for a gesture based 
                music control system which would allow you to rewind, stop or play music based on your gestures from the other side of the room.

            <div><h3>Soccer Pal</h3></div>
            <div><p> The soccer pal is a head wearable that helps you make the right choice when playing soccer. Soccer is a big part of my life and I play as a winger. Sometimes
                I struggle to decide whether to cross the ball or shoot, based on the angle, and the other teammates that are helping me. The idea of this wearable is that it would analyse the situation and 
                project a heads up display with clear communication about the statistic best action to do. This would be cool to use in trainings.

            <div><h3>Wizard bot</h3></div>
            <div><p>I think many people design robots in order to do something functional but I remember when I was most obsessed with robots, as a child, it was because they could be 
                fun to play with. This is a wizard robot who casts spells by moving its arm in a direction, which then you have to dodge. A sensor or camera views whether you moved in the opposite
                direction fast enough, and has sound feedback based on hit or miss.

            <div><h3>Immersive cubes</h3></div>
            <div><p>When discussing immersive experiences, such as the famous Rain room, I started to think about this allowing you to do what you wanted to as a kid. I know
                running through the rain wasn't the most practical which is a large reason why I think the rain room succeeded. I wondered if this could be applied to other experiences, particularly ones
                with childhood wonder. These sketches show a 'fire' room and an 'underwater' room. This could be done with special lighting effects or elements of AR.

            <div><p>Continuing on from the immersive rooms, when someone mentioned a lava lamp in class I remembered how enamored I was with them as a child.
                It would be so amazing and childish to be able to experience an immersive space that felt like you were in a lava lamp. This could be achieved with VR or AR or other technologies.

            <div><h3>Shawn Says</h3></div>
            <div><p>Shawn Says is an clear take on the typical kids game Simon Says. I work with kids and get quite tired running these sessions and coming up with new 
                combinations; so I sketched up a robot that could do it for me. He is named after my dad. Shawn Says could say one thing, then do another and try to catch kids out. For bonus points
                it would be cool if he had a camera and could identify which kids got it wrong!

            <div><h3>Ardunio Guitar</h3></div>
            <div><p>Doing my research on the Arduino, it is clear that an Arduino piano is common and achievable. I am a piano player so love that idea, but my partner
                only plays guitar. I wondered if Arduino could make a guitar, but the research does not show many examples. I am not sure how exactly it would work but this is 
                my sketch of my inital idea to create a GuitarHero style guitar. This has capacitive touch sections for different chords like guitar hero, and then uses the 
                joystick for the 'strumming' movement.

            <div><p>The main way my roomates and I hang out is by playing mariokart. We have my old nintendo wii set up from early 2000s which is very nostalgic for us all.
                Though alot of us have become pretty good at it, others have never played it in their life and are therefore severly lacking in the roommate competitions. I wondered if you could
                use camera detection of the screen, or link it up in the backend, to be able to code a stand to move left and right to optimise play.

            <div><h3>Story buddy</h3></div>
            <div><p>The story buddy would be used with kids along side digital storybooks. I know that childrens book can be expensive 
                and often kids grow out of them quickly, so if digital books become more popular, I thought it would be good to still have a physical component. This is a robot that 
                acts out specific actions in the story; which would allow for interactive stoytelling where the child picks the story and then the robot responds.
