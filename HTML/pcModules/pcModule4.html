    <h2 class="moduleDescription">Learning physical computing is mostly about hands on practise with the circuit boards. So, below is the documentation of the 
        key Arduino builds using different components to achieve different things.

            <div><h3>Fish Playground: Circuit Diagram</h3></div>
            <div><p>One of the projects with Arduino was based on a project that played with fishbowl decorations when a fish cast a shadow on it.
                This build utilises a light sensor, as pictured in the diagram. A servo motor is also attached, as shown in blue.

            <div><h3>Fish Playground: Code</h3></div>
            <div><p>The code for fish playground links the photosensitive receptor to the servo motor. The code makes it so when it detects light it 
                stays at one angle, and when it is covered, or it encounters a shadow it flips the other way.

            <div><h3>Fish Playground: Build</h3></div>
            <div><p>The build itself wasn't too complicated but I spent a while walking through the logic of how the electricity was flowing.
                For example, I didn't immediately understand how the sensor and motor were linked or worked together. We also discussed the difference between 
                digital and analog pins.

            <div><p>Capacitive touch works when the signals that are received pass a certain threshold, which is specified, to trigger a behaviour. In this case, we just used
                a simple red LED light to understand when we were touching something and completing the circuit or not.
