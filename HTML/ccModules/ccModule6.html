    <h1>Module 6: Offline Algorithmic Thinking</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This module is about how the concept of algoithms and algorithmic thinking can 
        be applied to the real world and offline applications. Many things we do every day could be considered
        an algorithm, and this moudle explores different contexts of structure, and randomness.<h2>

            <div><h3>Initial In Class Dice Game</h3></div>
            <div><p>The aim of this in class activity was to create a game using two dice, and shapes. This combines
                the idea of randomness, and tasked us with using these elements to create an algorithm, thereby creating a particular output. Here,
                the die dictated what shape was placed on the paper, and if certain combinations were rolled, shapes were combined.

            <div><p>I decided to further my game at home after class. The final rules of the game are as follows. 
                1. The game is played on a 6 x 8 grid. 2. Roll a 6 sided and 8 sided die to find the respective x and y coorindates of shape placement on the grid.
                3. The remainder after the total of both scored is divded by 3 determines the shape. 4. Odd is pink, even is teal.

            <div><p>This shows what a short game, of eight rolls, might look like. It was interesting that the 6 sided dice never went above three. 
                This game could be further workshopped to add more colours, and double up shapes within the grid spot.

            <div><p>The task given to us was to live a day where at least 10 decisions were made using the roll of a die.
                I chose to complete this task on a Saturday, my day off, with my partner. I made a list of 10 decisions that a flip of a coin, equivalent to an odd or even die roll, could dictate.

            <div><h3>Die dictated excursion</h3></div>
            <div><p>Living a day based purely on randomness was really interesting and provoked alot of thought. For example, usually my partner and I can't decide
                what to do on a day off, so it was actually quite refreshing to not have to decide, and to go on this random adventure together instead. My highlight was going to 
                a gallery on Flinders Lane, that I definitely would have been too scared to enter without being forced to by the die.
