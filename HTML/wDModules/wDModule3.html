            <div><h3>Crazy 8's (In-Class): First Four</h3></div>
            <div><p>These first four crazy 8's I really tried to think creatively from the get-go. There are two main themes, of playful shapes, as well as longer rectangles
                The circles show a collapsable menu where more circle come off the main one during hover. The bottom right design is inspired by playschool and their shaped
                windows, and when you click a module you would navigate 'through' that shape into to the page's content.

            <div><h3>Crazy 8's (In-Class): Last Four</h3></div>
            <div><p> Once I got to the second four of the crazy-8s in class, I had a mix of more structured and unstructed. I really like the idea of incorporating 
                a natural element, as shown by the cat and tree and maybe using animals as buttons for the modules. My style of art is quite line-work based so 
                I feel that could be fun. In layout out information, however, I like to be quite structured so that important information is clear at first glance.
                Hence, the more structured ideas with the modular layouts of images and text e.g. top right.

            <div><h3>Crazy 8's (At Home): First Four</h3></div>
            <div><p>I decided to have another try at some more crazy-8s to expand my possible ideas. For these I ended up going more theme-based.
                These include a chatterbox, garden, scrabble theme, and a horizontal navigation system inspired from some of my research.

            <div><h3>Crazy 8's (At Home): Last Four</h3></div>
            <div><p>The final four of my at-home crazy-8s were themed around mushrooms, a fantasy quest, photobooth and a sheppard with sheep on a hill.
                These are just some of the theming ideas I had for my website, but I became slightly overwhelmed with the sheer amount of possibility. Instead, I decided to intially markup all the content 
                for the module pages first, and then have the opportunity to tie this intp a theme later on.
                For more development documentation, check out my specific 'Site Progress' section.
