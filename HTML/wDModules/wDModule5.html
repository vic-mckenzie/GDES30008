    <h1>Module 5: Fluid Design</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This module is focussed on responsive design and media queries. Though I missed this class due to a medical appointment, I have used this as an opportunity to 
        analyse the responsiveness of my website and plan the most ideal scenario for mobile screens. Below shows the sketches for a mobile device, as well as the various other sizes of layout that 
        my website should account for, on multiple different pages.

            <div><h3>Landing Page</h3></div>
            <div><p>I would like this landing page to be really simple and clean, with an animation added, perhaps at a later stage. I would like this 
                to resemeble the sleek black outside of most sketch books, that are very simplistic, hiding the artistic chaos within. Simple instructions 
                will work best here.

            <div><h3>Navigation Home Page</h3></div>
            <div><p>This page will act as a contents table, and will like to all modules once projects 2B and 2C are completed.
                I would like this page to be quite chaotic and visually stimulating, feeling abundant and expressive. At later stages I may 
                add animations or hover effects over the sketches too. The key goal of this page is to link to the 3 main subsections of the book, corresponding to projects 2A, B and C.

        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Module Pages</h3></div>
            <div><p>The layout for the module page I would like to be more structured. Here, my focus is communicating messages and showcasing progress photos,
                so artistic distractions, whilst still interesting, should be more restricted. A structured photo and text combination will make my reflections for each activity clear.

        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Site Progress Page</h3></div>
            <div><p>One of my other goals for this first project, 2A, was to create an entirely seperate Site Progress page to document my brainstorming, and 
                website design. I chose this because I think seperating the in class activities from website development is more clear, and this also has the opporutnity for a layout 
                that can show more photos at once, rather than focussing on a more artistic style like the module pages.
