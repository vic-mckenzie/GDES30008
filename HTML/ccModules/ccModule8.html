    <h1>Module 8: User Input</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This module is about the ways in which we, as humans, interact with technology, both currently and in the future.
        The below 'gestures' indicate either current or speculative ways humans interact with electronic objects to complete certain behaviours.<h2>

        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Gesture 1, Current: Paying by tapping phone</h3></div>
            <div><p>The gesture here is using our hands to place two electronic items next to eachother 
                to pay for something. This is also usually accompanied with a glance down at the phone, 
                as well as a double click to verify your identity.</p></div>

            <div><h3>Gesture 2, Current: Tapping and swiping on mall navigation</h3></div>
            <div><p>These gestures include pressing buttons, tapping, swiping and then ultimately following the directions 
                of an interactive map exhibit in shopping centres. This is a good exmaple of an interactive technology that is not our phones
                that we use in our lives.

            <div><h3>Gesture 3, Current: Using a myki at the train station</h3></div>
            <div><p>This interaction includes the use of public transport, such as trains, trams or buses, and the 
                technology they have installed at these locations. For exmaple, the electronic gates at train stations 
                require you to use your hand to place your myki card on the readers at the entry.

            <div><h3>Gesture 4, Future: Waving</h3></div>
            <div><p>I think that the concept of more gestural waving with our entire hand is something that should be utilised more
                in the future. We indicate movement with our fingers alot currently, however as interactive technologies progress 
                I think using the whole arm, or at least including the wrist and forarm to indicate direction or movement could be interesting.

            <div><h3>Gesture 5, Future: Smiling</h3></div>
            <div><p>Smiling is one of the most beautiful human behaviours, so it would be nice if interactive technology could celebrate this 
                more. Perhaps something like a triggered camera to capture candid laughing or joyful moments. At the moment smiling is not utilised, and can even
                negatively affect technologies, e.g. Face Recognition, but I hope this will evolve.

            <div><h3>Gesture 6, Future: Squinting</h3></div>
            <div><p>Squinting can indicate alot about the scenario a person is in, and eye momvement in general is really indicative of the human experience.
                Utilising it in the context of being tired, or even just weather patterns could be interesting to connect the individual with the external environment, through technologies.
