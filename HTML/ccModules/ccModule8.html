    <h1>Module 8: User Input</h1>
    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This module is about the ways in which we, as humans, can provide input for web scripts to use with an algorithm, to produce output.
        I have come up with 4 different ways we can provide input to web technology.<h2>

    <div class="moduleContainer left">
        <div><img src="../../ASSETS/ccAssets/mouseAttraction.png" alt="green square" class="moduleImage"></div>
        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Using the mouse</h3></div>
            <div><p>Using the mouse, also including clicking the mouse and tapping screens for mobile technologies, are by far the most common option for user input.
                The mouses is useful because it can be perfectly controlled and is always precise in its movements. Many things can be created using proximity to mouse, hover effects,
                moving direction, coordinates, or clicking actions.
            </p></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="moduleContainer center">
        <div><img src="../../ASSETS/ccAssets/keyboardInput.png" alt="green square" class="moduleImage"></div>
        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Using the keyboard</h3></div>
            <div><p>Using the keyboard is another common user input method. Creating things according to what letter a user presses, or combinations are common. Additionally,
                many things can be created using words, and type that the keyboard can help the user create.
            </p></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="moduleContainer right">
        <div><img src="../../ASSETS/ccAssets/face.png" alt="green square" class="moduleImage"></div>
        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Using facial expressions from webcam</h3></div>
            <div><p>Facial expressions are something I have not seen used in many web scripts at the moment. There is definitely 
                concern about safety and recognision of faces, which may hinder this progression, however there are some really cool things that can 
                come from both facial expressions, and face layouts too. 
            </p></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="moduleContainer right inverse">
        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Using sound from microphone</h3></div>
            <div><p>Using sound or audio recorded can be a really cool way of integrating user input. This immediately makes me think of Scream Go Hero,
                and old mobile game similar to 'Flappy Bird' where you had to scream to jump. Singing, or other music could also be interesting for input.
            </p></div>
        </div>
        <div><img src="../../ASSETS/ccAssets/ScreamHero.png" alt="green square" class="moduleImage"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="moduleContainer left inverse">
        <div class="moduleText">
            <div><h3>Poses from webcam</h3></div>
            <div><p>Using the webcame can also be a way for input with websites. This student example shows 
                a variable font that is stretched and tilted based on the users physical arm placement. This utilises Posenet 
                which is an addition to p5.
