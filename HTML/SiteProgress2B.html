                    some of the techniques I learnt in this video.

                <div><p>One of the issues I ran into when making this animation was the 'furry' appearance of the text, that occured due to way 
                    the algorithm would work out what the 'next point' in the array to throw a 'dart' at is. This was fixed after troubleshooting by
                    increasing a 'closeness' tolerance value.

                <div><h3>How the Welcome Message Works</h3></div>
                <div><p>The way the welcome message works, is by creating a target array of points, made from the text to points function,
                    and then a second 'dart' array, to move points toward their matching targets. I spent alot of time on this code, and learning about 
                    linear interpolation, or lerp, was really intersting to me.

                <div><h3>Problem: Joined Letters</h3></div>
                <div><p>Another problem I encountered when making the welcome message was the ability for the code to tell when one letter ends and another starts.
                    This led to joined letters that did not look good. The solution to this issue was in telling the code how close the 'distBetween' the two points,
                    previous and current dart, could be determined as most probable to be a different letter or stroke.

                <div><h3>Drawing on Canvas</h3></div>
                <div><p>Previously in 2A I had tried to code teh ability to draw on the screen with a mouse by using vanilla JS and HTML to 
                    create a canvas. The code was complicated and the functionality was inconsistent. I also found it frustrating that I couldn't 
                    draw over or under other HTML elements. When I learnt P5, I knew I was going to update this, so now I implemented the drawing 
                    functionality for users when they first arrive, and they can draw in the sketchbook next to the welcome message.

                <div><p>The next thing I looked into with P5 was the possibity of drawing random lines. I had a random colour 
                    being selected for the link on hover, and I like the idea of having more things that are different each time
                    you visit the website. Completey randomly generated lines like sketchbook scribbling were what I had in mind.

                <div><h3>Problem: Rigid Lines</h3></div>
                <div><p>The first issue I encountered while trying to create random scribbles was that they didn't look organic, and 
                    were very rigid, with sharp points. This did not look like a human had drawn it in their sketchbook. The solution to this, was learning about
                    curve vertexes. Though there a few quirks, such as anchor points and fill that tripped me up in my learnings, they are a valuable thing to have in my toolkit now.

                <div><h3>Problem: Immediately Appearing</h3></div>
                <div><p>My other issue with my inital understanding of P5 was that the lines I was drawing always appeared the entire line at once, 
                    rather than appearing to be 'drawn' and going start to finish like a penstroke. The solution here was to change the incrementation of each line segment, keep track 
                    of whether the line is finished or not, and ultimately decrease the framerate to slowen the page of the line.
