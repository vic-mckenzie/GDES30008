    <h2 class="moduleDescription">This page is to showcase a few snippets of my brainstorming, ideation, prototyping and coding 
        processes. Though not every step is shown, the most important or pertinent have been highlighted to encapsulate a general idea of my process and major

                    that we use in our lives.
