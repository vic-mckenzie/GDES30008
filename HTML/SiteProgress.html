                    my 'sketchbook' felt like mine, and felt loose and organic, so I opted to create my own font with my real handwriting.
                    I used a program called calligraphr and wrote on my ipad, then converted it to a ttf file, and linked it to my website.

                    as shown in the module pages, and progressed to add this styling.

                    I wanted to fit this into my sketchbook idea and make it more interactive so I created a canvas and added JavaScript functions I sourced online. It lets you 
                    draw on a canvas in the background of the contents page, at a z-1 index, and then dissapears after a few seconds.

                <div><p>I encountered a small issue with Github while trying to test that the website could go live. I think I had accidentally created a 
                    second branch and my updates were no longer syncing properly, but could not push,pull or update anything. After investigating this in the terminal
                    I worked through it and fixed the merge conflicts, but sometimes my CSS is still not as reliable on the Github version as it is on LiveServer.
